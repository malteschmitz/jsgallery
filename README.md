jsgallery provides an JavaScript object which dynamically inserts the gallery on your website using the DOM. You can add single images and titles or add many images with file names following some rules.

Images can be selected by clicking on the thumbnails or by next and previous buttons. jsgallery provides an automatic slide show, too.
