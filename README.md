jsgallery provides an JavaScript object which dynamicly inserts the gallery on your website using dom. You can add single images and titles or add many images with filenames following some rules.

Images can be selected by clicking on the thumbnails or by next and previous buttons. jsgallery provides an automatic slide show, too.
